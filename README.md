# Urban Morphology Side-by-Side

by Yongha Hwang

This web page provides morphological comparison across world cities in an easy
way. The scale across maps is kept always the same. You can change the scale by using
the zoom slider at the top left corner or wheel-scroll on the map.

The style is inspired by Allen Jacobs' ["Great Streets"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Streets-Press-Allan-Jacobs/dp/0262600234) and [Geoff Boeing's Jupyter Notebook](http://geoffboeing.com/2017/01/).

- The map is styled and rendered using [Mapbox-gl.js] (https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).
- A city's location is found with its name using [Nominatim] (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).
