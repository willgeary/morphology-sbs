# Urban Morphology Side-by-Side

by Yongha Hwang

This web page provides morphological comparison acrss world cities in a easy
way. The scale across maps is kept always same. You can change scale by using
the zoom slider at the top left corder or wheel scrolling in the map.

The style is inspired by Allen Jacobs' ["Great Streets"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Streets-Press-Allan-Jacobs/dp/0262600234) and [Geoff Boeing's Jupyter Notebook](http://geoffboeing.com/2017/01/).  

See the demo:

- The map is styled and rendered using [Mapbox-gl.js] (https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).
- A city's location is found with its name using [Nominatim] (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).

If you prefer to see one large map with this style, use this page:
